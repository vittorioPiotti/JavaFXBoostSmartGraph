# (JavaFX) PathGraph


## Project Origin
BoostSmartGraph was created out of the necessity for a specialized library to represent, manage, and interact with path graphs, particularly for use in pathfinding algorithms. After an unsuccessful search for an existing solution, it was decided to develop an adapted version based on the SmartGraph library.

## Fork Motivation
The primary need was to improve certain functionalities of SmartGraph that, while useful, were not fully optimal for managing path graphs in specific applications. In the absence of a pre-made library that met these requirements, SmartGraph was chosen as the foundation for the creation of BoostSmartGraph.

## Key Objectives

- **Optimization**: The original features of SmartGraph were reviewed and optimized to enhance performance in the context of path graphs.
- **New Features**: New functionalities were added to simplify the dynamic representation and management of graphs, making BoostSmartGraph a versatile tool for developing path-related algorithms.
- **Enhanced Interaction**: Specific improvements were made to enable greater interactivity with the graphs, providing developers with a smoother and more comprehensive user experience.

## Conclusion
BoostSmartGraph addresses the lack of specialized libraries for managing and interacting with path graphs by introducing new features and improving those present in SmartGraph. This fork stands out for its ability to more effectively tackle the challenges related to path graphs, offering advanced support for developing pathfinding algorithms.
