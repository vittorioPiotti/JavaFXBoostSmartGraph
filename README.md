# (JavaFX) PathGraph

## Why Path Graph
If you need a ready-to-use library for the representation of path graphs with nodes, edges, and associated weights, offering advanced features for user interface representation, management, and interaction with path graphs, then PathGraph is the right solution for you.

## Project Origin
BoostSmartGraph was created out of the necessity for a specialized library to represent, manage, and interact with path graphs, particularly for use in pathfinding algorithms. After an unsuccessful search for an existing solution, it was decided to develop an adapted version based on the SmartGraph library.

## Fork Motivation

SmartGraph being the most suitable library to be adapted for this purpose and the primary need was to improve certain functionalities of SmartGraph that, while useful, were not fully optimal for managing path graphs in specific applications. In the absence of a pre-made library that met these requirements, SmartGraph was chosen as the foundation for the creation of BoostSmartGraph being the most suitable library to adapt for this purpose..

## Key Objectives

- **Optimization**: The original features of SmartGraph were reviewed and optimized to suit of path graphs.
- **New Features**: New features have been added to represent, manage and interact with path graphs ensuring dynamic updating of components from user events making BoostSmartGraph a versatile tool for developing path-related algorithms
- **Enhanced Interaction**: Interactions with the user are more complex from the optimization of those already present to the implementation of other specifications in order to fully guarantee dynamic management and a structured representation of the path graphs

## Conclusion
BoostSmartGraph addresses the lack of specialized libraries for managing and interacting with path graphs by introducing new features and adapting those present in SmartGraph. This fork stands out for its ability to more effectively tackle the challenges related to path graphs, offering advanced support for developing pathfinding algorithms.
