# (JavaFX) PathGraph


If you need a ready-to-use library for the representation of path graphs with nodes, edges, and associated weights, offering advanced features for user interface of representing, managing, and interacting with path graphs, then PathGraph is the right solution for you.
It was decided to develop an adapted version based on the [SmartGraph](https://github.com/brunomnsilva/JavaFXSmartGraph) library.
