## Project Explanation

### Project Origin
PathGraph was created out of the necessity for a specialized library to represent, manage, and interact with path graphs, particularly for use in pathfinding algorithms. After an unsuccessful search for an existing solution, it was decided to develop an adapted version based on the SmartGraph library.

### Fork Motivation

In the absence of a pre-made library that met these requirements, SmartGraph was chosen as the foundation for the creation of PathGraph being the most suitable library to adapt for this purpose.

### Key Objectives

- **Optimization**: The original features of SmartGraph were reviewed and optimized to suit of path graphs.
- **New Features**: New features have been added to represent, manage and interact with path graphs ensuring dynamic updating of components from user events making PathGraph a versatile tool for developing path-related algorithms
- **Enhanced Interaction**: Interactions with the user are more complex from the optimization of those already present to the implementation of other specifications in order to fully guarantee dynamic management and a structured representation of the path graphs

### Conclusion
PathGraph addresses the lack of specialized libraries for managing and interacting with path graphs by introducing new features and adapting those present in SmartGraph. This fork stands out for its ability to more effectively tackle the challenges related to path graphs, offering advanced support for developing pathfinding algorithms.
